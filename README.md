# UFOs
## Overview
Dana wants to take UFO related data and create a website that is easily searchable. You are asked to build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array and create filters to make this table fully dynamic and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. The webpage is customized using Bootstrap, and the table will have several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with the visualizations. 

## Purpose
To provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings, we update the code to allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
After writing JavaScript and HTML files to create a filter for date, we update the code to add filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

Users can see all filters when on the webpage.

With the additional filters, users can sort the data by one or multiple criteria.

## Summary
### Drawback
One drawback of this webpage is that the filter search looks only for an exact match and is case sensitive. If a user does not imput an exact match, no results will be shown.

### Recommendations
In addition to the possiblity of updating the filter to account for case sensitivity/partial match, a couple recommendations for further development are:
1) To provide further examples of the type of data in the data set that can be filtered. For example, one of the "shapes" in the data is "light," which is not intuitively a shape that a user may search for. 
2) Add a filter that would allow the user to search for a specific or range of "duration" related to the UFO sighting
